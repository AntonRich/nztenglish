So far I haven't picked up the steam for writing consistently. Let's pick up that pace now.

As Russians say, "Каша в голове" which roughly translates to, "Porridge in the head". I'll need to find a better way on how to express that state of being.

Just a list of random ideas for now:
- Reflect more
- Reflection time should take place right after the lesson.
- I've made a lot of notes to look up translatios form Russian to English.
- So far the way I assessed was by using the English Grammar Test app on android.
- I need to create this page! Resources
- A reflection journal for Coursera Teaching English Fundamentals.
- A reflection journal for TKT!
- I need to remember all the games and activities I played in English clubs.

Ideas:
- Use pinterest and print it.
- I can use collocations one at a time.
- I can use phrasal verbs one at a time.
