I really liked today's lesson. Despite the fact that I haven't prepared well for today's lesson, it was a really good one.

I've started lowering the bar.

There was a new student whose level I didn't check. I didn't give him any tests but... I checked his level by noticing some patterns. When he did a simple exercise he correctly used the combinations between verbs and prepositions.

The I. student and the A. student.

Things that occurred during the lesson:

**Бесполезно - useless.**

Other variations:
{{% ticks %}}
* to no avail https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/avail
* it's no good.
{{% /ticks %}}

**Все мы немножко менеджеры**

* We are all managers a bit.

**I'm drawing a blank**

* I'm stuck. I can't think of anything.
* I froze.

There was a situation where the student I. couldn't remember the word. He used the Russian word "зависнуть" to describe his state.

** Gravity ~~draws~~ us down.~~

* The gravity pulls us down.

I find TheFreeDictionary quite useful. For example I can find the 'kn' words [here](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/words-that-start-with-kn).

A couple notes to my future self:

* Teach these [intensifying expressions](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/topics/language/intensifying-expressions/) in my future lessons.
* [Darn](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/darn?topic=intensifying-expressions) will probably be the first.
* Words to teach 'kn': knob, knee, knife, knight, knowledge, know.
* While I was reflecting on today's lesson I come up with a new activity. We counted today. So I can change this activity. "Count from 20 to 30 but put between each count a countable noun. 21 apples, 22 fingers, 23 teeth, 24 spoons of sugar, etc."
