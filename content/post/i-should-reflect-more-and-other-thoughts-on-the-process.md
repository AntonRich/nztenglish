So far, I haven't been reflecting as much as I should. That maybe due to setting up this blog.

There's a Russian expression "Каша в голове" which translates to ["mess in my head"](https://context.reverso.net/translation/russian-english/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0+%D0%B2+%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5).


Just a list of random ideas for now:
- Reflect more
- Reflection time should take place right after the lesson.
- I've made a lot of notes to look up translatios from Russian to English.
- So far the way I assessed was by using the English Grammar Test app on android.
- A reflection journal for Coursera Teaching English Fundamentals.
- A reflection journal for TKT!
- I need to remember all the games and activities I played in English clubs.

Ideas:
- There are a lot of printables on pinterest. I certainly should try to print them.
- I can teach collocations every lesson in small portions.
- I can do the same for phrasal verbs.
