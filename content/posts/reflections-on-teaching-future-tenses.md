The video about Future Tense:

This video has good examples:

I collect one bottle of wine a week. By the end of the month I will have collected 4 bottles.

My last exam is on the 22nd. On the 23rd I will have started my holidays.

My boss wants the report by 6pm. I don't think I will have fineshed until at least 8 pm.

Another video that I liked was:

Examples from the video:

Complete the sentence: By January 2021, I...

By January 2021, you will have become great English speakers.

By January 2021, I will have finished my degree.

By the time we get there, they will have left.

So, I thought of quickly jumping to difficult future tenses.

That's what I thought.

I then quickly found out that Future Perfect is an uncommon tense and I don't think it was useful to teach it at that stage.

Plus, I don't feel the flow of that tense myself.

Now, Future Continuous, on the other hand, is much more common.

I showed this little interesting clip:

Another one I showed was a video by BBC.

Another tenses were: [to be to - future obligation](https://www.ef.com/wwen/english-resources/english-grammar/future-obligation/), will or going to.

I might add that EF grammar page has some good grammar explanations.

Here's where I've been asked a question about whether a sentence 'I will go ~~to~~ get some from the shop' was correct. To which I replied, that it could be used in this form 'I will go get some from the shop'. Then I was asked why we drop 'to' here. To which I didn't have a reply because it was my intuitive sense that was telling me to drop the 'to' particle.
