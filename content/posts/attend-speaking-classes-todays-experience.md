While it's more or less fresh on my mind, I should reflect on today's experience of attending English speaking classes arranged by Julia.

Although the class was organized by Julia it's being taught by Kate.

**What did I learn today?**

Pictures and Imagination.

Most of the vocabulary is not hard.

But that's not how I should view vocabulary.

How well can I use?

Can I imagine the situation where that vocabulary is used?

What was the structure of the lesson?

One little thing that was hard was.

Matching synonyms was very engaging and useful.

One little caviat. It would have been better to have Numbered List. I could change that myself though.
