I decided to dive deeper into the topic of articles and master them. Despite the fact that I use them correctly. Which is probably just my arrogance.

MyGrammarLab B1-B2

Mistakes I made:

Module 1, exercise 2

8. The picture was painted in sixteenth century.

It should be: The picture was panited in the sixteenth century.

With use the with historical periods.

9. The best panitings are in the room 18.

There should be no article before `room`. Haven't yet found out why.

Nice thing about this exercise is that it points to the units I should look into if I made a mistake.

So I did.

And then I did other exercises:

Unit 4, exercises 1 and 2 no mistakes.

Exercies 3, I've made one mistake:

2. When you get to Stansed Airport check in at 8.45 a.m. and go to the Gate 56 for flight EZ1221.

Gate should be without the definite article.



Let's say my goal is to teach definite article specifically.
I can use the table above.
