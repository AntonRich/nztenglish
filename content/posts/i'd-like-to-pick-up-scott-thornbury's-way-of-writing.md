As I was googling "Textbooks for TEFL" I came across an article by Scott Thornbury on [teachingenglish.org](https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/teaching-unplugged). I started reading it and felt an urge to write down the vocabulary he used in the article. However, when I started writing the vocabulary down I also started writing phrases. I was about to finish reading the article when I saw the link to his other post about Dogme on his website. I clicked it and wanted to write down the vocabulary again, but instead I jotted down whole paragraphs. Because I liked how Scott expresses his thoughts.

I would very much like to pick up his way of expessing thoughts.
