On Friday, Ferbruary 7th I've learned things like:
* Pedestrian crossing
* get off the bus

Things I should learn:
* To **better** understand the teacher's role. To that end, in TKT Glossary there is a term called **Teacher Role**.
* You**'d better** help them.
* How to translate: "Солист группы".
* How to teach "in common" and "in general", what is the defference between them.
