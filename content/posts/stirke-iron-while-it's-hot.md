I'm working on "getting things done" mentality. Though, I'm disgusted by my lack of consistency in terms of writing. I now know that if those negative feelings of disgust don't help, it is better to get rid of them. It is better to only allow these feelings in case they give you motivation.

Emotionally, I want to be passive and watch youtube, Better call Saul, or whatever. I want to avoid the dull, tedious work and I just have a lot of that kind of work on my plate. Though, I wouldn't say I'm completely avoiding the work. For one thing, I study grammar. I do it almost every day. It's not all roses, you know.

Do the real thing.

Watch the videos in skype and make more notes.

P.S. Just before publishing, an image came to my mind--a student handing in his late assignment to a professor. His head is down. He's feeling guilty. He knew he could have done the assignment much earlier. He was just putting it off. He finished it last minute. It's still some kind of work, yet it's sloppy.
